## CSC1109 Sandbox

Welcome to the sandbox for the CSC1109 labs! This sandbox includes a full, integrated data science
stack that makes all of the various technologies we will be learning about during the semester of
lab work. These technologies include:

- A hadoop cluster
- A spark cluster
- A hive cluster
- A pig interpreter

All configured to be interoperable and usable as part of a single, interactive notebook
environment.
