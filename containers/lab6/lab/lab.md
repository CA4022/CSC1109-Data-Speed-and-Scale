## Lab 6 - Machine Learning with Spark

This lab will explore how we can use the experience we have built so far to develop machine
learning systems capable of processing vast amounts of data in a scalable, efficient manner. This
lab will place you in an interactive, jupyter environment with access to the full power and
capabilities of a (locally simulated, of course) Spark cluster.
