# CSC1109 - Data Speed and Scale

## Overview

This repository contains the materials for DCU's CSC1109 laboratory module covering the topic of
"Data Speed and Scale". This course is focused on the handling of big/extreme data, distributed
computing, and how to use these techniques to create efficient and performant distributed systems.
The course makes heavy use of containerisation to locally simulate small distributed systems as a
means to build hands-on experience in distributed computing. This repository specifically contains
the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files for the course, including:

- The content of the website for course materials
- Spellchecking, link verification, and other useful doctests
- The CI/CD build pipeline for that website
- The container files for the lab course
- The CI/CD build pipeline for those containers
- Automated testing pipelines for verifying the correctness of code examples
- Utilities for efficient workflow when working within the repo
- A justfile containing ready-to-use commands for efficient workflow

This repo aims to provide a comprehensive and reliable single source of truth for our lab
materials, providing a comfortable environment for students to learn within and minimizing
friction for the maintainers of course materials.
